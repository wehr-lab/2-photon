* Network analysis

** Data checks 
1. Check the value types of the full matrix
2. How sparse is the matrix? 
3. Is the graph fragmented or 1 connected component? 
6. Since the GC matrix is sparse, how do the connections and their density track with the pupil size? 
7. Bin the matrix and other data
8. Multilayer graphs algorithms from Basset. 

9. Static graph: Module max and rich club analysis  
5. Align spikes, pupil size, and GC matrix temporally.
** Philosophical problems 
4. Problem of partial observability
