This file notes the general direction to load .mat files in Python.
.mat files are MATLAB files that store data in a structured format. While parsing these files in Python, it is often tricky to get the data in the desired format. Therefore, this file notes the general direction to load .mat files in Python.

## Steps to load .mat files in Python
1. Install the `scipy` library.
2. Import the `scipy.io` module. This has sio.loadmat() function to load .mat files.
3. Use the `sio.loadmat()` function to load the .mat file. Use `struct_as_record=True` to load the file as numpy record arrays. This allows indexing the data using the dot notation.

Numpy record arrays look like this:
a = np.array([(1.0, 2), (3.0, 4)], dtype=[('x', 'f4'), ('y', 'i4')])

Here, the array is a collection of tuples, where each tuple object has two elements. The first element is a float and the second element is an integer. The dtype parameter specifies the data type of each element in the tuple.

Example:
`behavior.mat` file has the following data:
When loaded using `sio.loadmat('behavior.mat', struct_as_record=True)`, the data can be accessed as:
`data = sio.loadmat('behavior.mat', struct_as_record=True)`
Its keys are:
1. Head
2. Reye
3. Sky 

All of the keys have values that are numpy record arrays. The data can be accessed using the dot notation.
All these fields are numpy record arrays. To view the names of the fields, use: `data.dtype.names`. 

Also, I have written the `extract_value` function that extracts the 0th-most element from the numpy record array. This function can be used to extract the data from the numpy record arrays.

Events class: This class is used to store the data from 1 trial in the Events.mat file. Its attributes are the fields of the events record array. 

Maybe: Experiment class: Collection of Events objects. 
Add: Cell class for SortedUnits. 
TODO: 


Maybe: Session class: Collection of Events class?
