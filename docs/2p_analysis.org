Analyses done on 2p data
1. Preprocessing after Suite2p:
1.1 dF/F computed 
1.2 Static FC computed from pairwise correlations
1.3 Thresholded at some percentile of the distribution of FC values

2. Analysis of static FC:
2.1 Hierarchical Clustering of static FC
2.2 Computed some graph metrics on threshold graph 


TODO
1. Dynamic FC analysis
2. Compare FC metrics of the graph with randomized graph 
3. Need to change the binarize matrix to first abs the matrix and then binarize it. Otherwise, we will lose the negative correlations that could be part of a module.
