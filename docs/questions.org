#+title: Questions

* What is this note about?
This note is the space I use to gather outstanding (not resolved) questions as I am developing my understanding of computation in networks.

* Questions
1. What do the dynamics of individual processing units (transistors) look like when we implement a certain algorithm in a neuromorphic chip?

2. How does the A (the weight matrix) change as we go from continuous state to discrete state?
