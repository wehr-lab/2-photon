1. When constructing the sessionProcessDF dataset, take the activity in this range: [-0.6, 0.5]. This is to make sure that the trial specific data is there regardless of what processing I want to do. For example, I wanted to do a arousal-wise decoding but had no data segment the arousal by pupil size as I only too up to -0.2 s before the tone presentation. I need the arousal level BEFORE the tone presentation and at least 0.5 s before the tone presentation to assign the trial into an araousal range.
