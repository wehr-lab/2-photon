Questions:
1. 1 frame = how much time? Or what is the frame rate for the matrices? 
2. The binning time: average of ISI? Got this idea from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGrJIcwhPlg&ab_channel=iiptv

Not all cells were used for network construction, so when we use the spiking data, use the "Resp" field of the hdf5todict converted dict. 

Before fitting SVM (or any classifier) for the tone decode data, make sure I am using the time points where the neural states are the furthest apart. 

Manifolds are plotted using the PSTH values for all cells. This only gives num_tones trajectories. I think I will try the per trial responses. 

Steps: 
1. Look at the pupil values 0.6 sec to 0.1 sec before the tone onset. 
2. Average value per trial 
3. Classify the trials on the arousal bins 
4. Fit Linear classifier
